<p>This solution document covers the scenario of an IBM Cloud client (in this case, Anthem) who has either an on-premise or cloud VMware environment and is interested in migrating those workloads to IBM Cloud. However, they are not interested in utilizing IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions but rather would deploy their own VMware environment. Given that this solution utilizes two geographically distributed data centers, this solution can also be used to deploy a geographically resilient solution by performing replication between multiple data centers.</p>",meth_and_bp,https://ibm.box.com/s/vi446tu9z48gulo16aaf8i7wjjjgqyde,2024-04-23 14:38:16.352319+00,2024-04-23 14:38:16.352319+00,not_specific,cloud,cloud,f,f,0,"{""""}",Mike Nelson,,

<p>Whenever you work with numbers or digits that are written ('eight', 'acht', 'f&uuml;nfzehn') but your task requires numeric literals (8, 8, 15), Smart Format is the right library to use.</p>
<p>This often happens when you transcribe speech using Watson Speech-to-Text:</p>
<p>Imagine a voicebot where you can provide your customer ID in German will transcribe the following sentence&nbsp;<code>My customer ID is 55 6 V F 90 8 104</code>&nbsp;as&nbsp;<code>Meine Kundennummer ist f&uuml;nfundf&uuml;nzig sechs V F neunzig acht einhundertvier</code>. Using the smart format capability of this library in a pre-message webhook in Watson Assistant yields&nbsp;<code>Meine Kundennummer ist 55 6 V F 90 8 104</code>&nbsp;so that the customer ID can be worked with in backend systems.</p>

<h2>Playbook Structure:</h2>
<p>This playbook is constructed around a Main playbook that calls plays. Each play is built to perform a separate function ranging from MQ installation, Queue Manager creation/setup and/or interacting with the QM to perform additional actions. There is a properties file that gets passed in at execution time and this set of properties determines which plays will be executed and provides variable overrides.</p>
<p>The high level goals for the plays are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set up and cleanup of demonstration file structure. This process is used to provide a temporary repository for the archive files, locations for unarchiving and where the yum installations are performed from.</li>
<li>Default MQ plays, this set of plays performs the process of installation, update and cleanup/removal of MQ in the default location.</li>
<li>Side MQ plays, this set of plays is used to perform the installation and cleanup/removal of MQ from a user defined location vs the default location.</li>
<li>MQ Queue Manager plays &ndash; used in the setup and management of Queue Managers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to use the Playbook:</h2>
<p>Execution: To execute the play book, after you have cloned the Git repository and updated the inventory file or created a new one, call the Main playbook while passing in a properties file that determines which selected plays will be executed.</p>
<p>Examples: #2 &amp; #3 add an alternate inventory file, #3 also adds light verbosity</p>
<p><code>ansible-playbook MQ-Main.yml -e &ldquo;@mq-sample.props&rdquo;</code></p>

This paper expands the reference architecture to cover all of the major vertical areas of healthcare and life sciences industries, such as genomics, imaging, and clinical and translational research.
The architecture was renamed IBM Reference Architecture for High Performance Data and AI in Healthcare and Life Sciences to reflect the fact that it incorporates key building blocks for high-performance computing (HPC) and software-defined storage, and that it supports an expanding infrastructure of leading industry partners, platforms, and frameworks. The reference architecture defines a highly flexible, scalable, and cost-effective platform for accessing, managing, storing, sharing, integrating, and analyzing big data, which can be deployed on-premises, in the cloud, or as a hybrid of the two. IT organizations can use the reference architecture as a high-level guide for overcoming data management challenges and processing bottlenecks that are frequently encountered in personalized healthcare initiatives, and in compute-intensive and data-intensive biomedical workloads.

By investigating the human genome in the context of biological pathways, drug interaction, and environmental factors, it is now possible for genomic scientists and clinicians to identify individuals at risk of disease, provide early diagnoses based on biomarkers, and recommend effective treatments. However, the field of genomics has been caught in a flood of data as huge amounts of information are generated by next-generation sequencers and rapidly evolving analytical platforms such as high-performance computing clusters. This data must be quickly stored, analyzed, shared, and archived, but many genome, cancer and medical research institutions and pharmaceutical companies are now generating so much data that it can no longer be timely processed, properly stored or even transmitted over regular communication lines. Often they resort to disk drive and shipping companies to transfer raw data to external computing center for processing and storage, creating an obstacle for speedy access and analysis of data.

64bc82fc-7ad7-46cf-8212-16b6acc1a2f2,Combining IBM technology to better manage cybersecurity,luke.major@ibm.com,"After a thorough market evaluation in 2020, Data Action (DA), a technology provider for alternative banks, awarded a contract to Vectra, a local security consulting and service specialist, for a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform refresh project. The SIEM solution chosen, IBM Security® QRadar®, was deployed as virtualized appliances using VMware and IBM FlashSystem® storage. While deploying QRadar on virtualized appliances is common, using high-performance FlashSystem storage controllers for this type of workload is not. The use of IBM’s propriety IBM FlashCore® Module (FCM) technology to store QRadar data has had a significant impact on the ability of the security operations center (SOC) to analyze security threats. The overall effect on response times has been remarkable, in some cases contributing to a reduction in analysis time from hours to minutes compared to the previous SIEM solution. Through the adoption of QRadar and IBM FlashCore technology, DA now runs incident analysis and reports in fractions of the time of thwat the previous SIEM solution was capable of. Where the average cost of a data breach is millions of dollars, the business value of any solution that helps deliver faster detection rates is self-evident, delivering potential savings in terms of time and money.",sol_temp,https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/data-action/,2024-09-30 18:53:21.003659+00,2025-04-24 12:55:09.07144+00,custom,systems,storage,t,t,1,{},Luke Major,World Wide,World Wide
